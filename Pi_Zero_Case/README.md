I made it a little more roomy inside to accomodate the ribbon cable and made the camera hole larger for wide-angle pi cameras.

# Summary

Loosely based off of Gowen's PiZero camera Housing. Needed something a tad more compact, and with a slight angle to the camera to point down from a high spot. Also removed unneeded holes while I was at it.

Included STEP file for easy modification.
